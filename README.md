# CWebkitGtk-Linux

`CWebkitGtk-Linux` is a Swift package for Linux (Ubuntu) that allows you to link against [WebKitGTK+](https://webkitgtk.org/) library.

This package is a wrapper around [WebKitGTK+](https://webkitgtk.org/) so you have to install it before hand, as well as `clang`:

```
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev clang
```
